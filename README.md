# SML-CML
A structured model grounded in human cognition—including worldview, phenomenology, hermeneutics, and abductive reasoning. Usable with LLMs and AI systems.

# 📘 SML-CML Framework

**SML-CML** is a two-layered reasoning framework designed to structure both **semantic interpretation** and **value-based evaluation**.

It aims to explicitly represent how humans generate meaning (SML) and assess it within a worldview (CML).  
This allows AI systems to move beyond surface-level correctness and engage with contextually valid reasoning.

## 1. Layer Definitions

### 🔹 SML (Semantic Meaning Layer)

Describes how a phenomenon is interpreted — the frame, perspective, or lens through which it is understood.

- Example: “Is this fatigue a sign of *Qi deficiency* or *dampness obstructing the spleen*?”
- SML structures abductive reasoning and diagnostic framing.

### 🔹 CML (Cosmological Meaning Layer)

Encodes the value system or worldview underpinning a given interpretation.

- Example: “Should health prioritize *harmony with nature* or *removal of pain*?”
- CML enables normative evaluation grounded in ethics, culture, or philosophy.

## 2. Functional Differences

| Layer | Function               | Focus                                |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| SML   | Structures the question | Meaning, interpretation              |
| CML   | Evaluates the framing   | Values, worldview, ethical alignment |

## 3. Application to AI and LLMs

SML-CML provides a framework for LLMs to generate and evaluate responses beyond simple pattern matching.

- **SML** enables LLMs to construct questions or explanations based on coherent interpretive structures.
- **CML** provides criteria to score whether those structures align with specific value systems.

### Example: Comparing AI-generated diagnoses

| Output | SML-based Interpretation        | CML Evaluation                        |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A: “Cold sensitivity is caused by blood deficiency.” | East Asian medicine lens | Aligned with harmony-oriented worldview |
| B: “Cold sensitivity is due to lack of exercise.”     | Western biomedical lens  | Aligned with productivity-focused worldview |

## 4. Use Cases

- **AI Diagnosis**: Evaluate interpretive validity, not just surface-level accuracy  
- **Cross-cultural Education**: Teach how worldviews shape reasoning  
- **Ethical Reasoning**: Make value assumptions behind moral judgments explicit  
- **Dialogue Systems**: Support negotiation across value pluralism

---

## 5. Why This Framework Matters

Most AI evaluation relies on "correctness" as defined by training data or tagged labels.  
But in domains like healthcare, ethics, and philosophy, **truth** depends on:

- How something is *framed*  
- Which *worldview* or *value system* it appeals to

**SML-CML** offers a way to:

- Make these layers explicit  
- Enable pluralistic and context-sensitive reasoning  
- Guide AI systems toward more meaningful interaction with human thought
