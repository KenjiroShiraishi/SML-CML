# SML-CML
A structured model grounded in human cognition‚Äîincluding worldview, phenomenology, hermeneutics, and abductive reasoning. Usable with LLMs and AI systems.

üìò SML-CML Framework

SML-CML is a two-layered reasoning framework designed to structure both semantic interpretation and value-based evaluation. It aims to explicitly represent how humans generate meaning (SML) and assess it within a worldview (CML). This allows AI systems to move beyond surface-level correctness and engage with contextually valid reasoning.


1. Layer Definitions

üîπ SML (Semantic Meaning Layer)

Describes how a phenomenon is interpreted‚Äîthe frame, perspective, or lens through which it is understood.
	‚Ä¢	Example: ‚ÄúIs this fatigue a sign of Qi deficiency or dampness obstructing the spleen?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	SML structures abductive reasoning and diagnostic framing.

üîπ CML (Cosmological Meaning Layer)

Encodes the value system or worldview underpinning a given interpretation.
	‚Ä¢	Example: ‚ÄúShould health prioritize harmony with nature or removal of pain?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	CML enables normative evaluation grounded in ethics, culture, or philosophy.

2. Functional Differences

Layer	Function	Focus
SML	Structures the question	Meaning, interpretation
CML	Evaluates the framing	Values, worldview, ethical fit

3. Application to AI and LLMs

SML-CML provides a framework for LLMs to generate and evaluate responses beyond pattern matching:
	‚Ä¢	SML allows LLMs to construct questions or explanations based on coherent interpretive structures.
	‚Ä¢	CML provides criteria for scoring whether those structures align with specific value systems.

Example: Comparing AI-generated diagnoses
Output	SML-based Interpretation	CML Evaluation
A: ‚ÄúCold sensitivity is caused by blood deficiency.‚Äù	East Asian medicine lens	Aligned with harmony-oriented worldview
B: ‚ÄúCold sensitivity is due to lack of exercise.‚Äù	Western biomedical lens	Aligned with productivity-f

4. Use Cases
	‚Ä¢	AI Diagnosis: Evaluate interpretive validity, not just accuracy
	‚Ä¢	Cross-cultural Education: Teach how worldviews shape reasoning
	‚Ä¢	Ethical Reasoning: Map assumptions behind different moral judgments
	‚Ä¢	Dialogue Systems: Support negotiation across value pluralism


5. Why This Framework Matters

Most AI evaluation relies on ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù as defined by training data or tagged labels.
But in domains like healthcare, ethics, and philosophy, truth depends on how something is framed and which worldview it appeals to.

SML-CML offers a way to:
	‚Ä¢	Make those layers explicit
	‚Ä¢	Enable pluralistic reasoning
	‚Ä¢	Guide AI systems to reason in context
