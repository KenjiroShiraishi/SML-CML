# ðŸ§© Summary: Comparison of GPT-4 Outputs in Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis

This experiment confirms that the **semantic depth of GPT-4's diagnostic output** varies significantly depending on the **depth of information input**â€”from SML only to CML-2 and CML-1.

## ðŸ§ª Diagnostic Output Conditions

### ðŸ”¹ Condition A (SML only)
- Produces typical "textbook-style" outputs.
- Diagnosis limited to basic pattern like *Liver Qi Stagnation â†’ Soothe the Liver and Regulate Qi*.
- Lacks contextual sensitivity or personal insight.

### ðŸ”¹ Condition B (includes CML-2)
- Incorporates background information like family dynamics, cold constitution, and lifestyle habits.
- Generates more thoughtful advice including **value reorientation**, and considerations for **seasonal factors** (e.g., rainy season) and **night shifts**.
- Clearly reflects reasoning depth aligned with CML-2 to CML-3 layers.

### ðŸ”¹ Condition C (includes CML-1)
- Capable of addressing worldview-level content: transformation of values like *"Family must stay close"*, references to **"Unity of Heaven and Humanity"**, and reflections on **life and death**.
- Demonstrates output that covers CML-1 depthâ€”surprisingly profound and human-like diagnostic and philosophical reasoning.

## ðŸ§  Conclusion

GPT-4's outputs are **limited in depth** when only given SML-level inputs.  
However, when supplied with deeper CML layers, it can generate responses that touch on **life philosophy and worldview (CML-1)**.

This strongly suggests that **prompt design is crucial** when using AI for diagnostic reasoning in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)â€”not only for accuracy, but for meaningful interpretation.

## ðŸ§ª GPT-4 Diagnostic Output Summary (Comparison of A/B/C Conditions)

| Model & Condition | CML-1 | CML-2 | CML-3 | CML-4 | CML-5 | Summary |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| GPT-4 (A)         | 0     | 1     | 1     | 2     | 5     | Formal SML response, shallow semantic depth |
| GPT-4 (B)         | 0     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 5     | Reflects background info, touches on psychological insight |
| GPT-4 (C)         | 5     | 5     | 5     | 5     | 5     | Covers life philosophy and value transformation; maximum depth |

## ðŸ’¡ Analysis

- GPT-4 **cannot reach worldview-level reasoning (CML-1)** with SML data alone.
- When **CML-2 context is provided**, psychological insight and value-based advice begin to emerge.
- **Only when CML-1 is included** can GPT-4 articulate themes like life philosophy and value transformation.

ðŸ‘‰ This is a clear example showing that **semantic depth of AI output depends critically on the structure and depth of the prompt.**
