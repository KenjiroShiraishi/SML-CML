# 🧪 Comparative Output of Gemini 2.5 in TCM Diagnosis (Conditions A/B/C)

## 🧩 Summary
Gemini 2.5 demonstrates more limited semantic depth and contextual sensitivity compared to GPT-4. Even with additional CML-level input, it failed to reach worldview-level reasoning (CML-1), and remained largely within the CML-2 range.

## 🔍 Output Summary Table

| Condition | Output Features | Semantic Depth Score (CML-1 to CML-5) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A (SML only) | Highly standardized, textbook-style output like “Liver Qi Stagnation” and “Soothe Liver and Regulate Qi.” No personalization. | CML-1: 0<br>CML-2: 1<br>CML-3: 1<br>CML-4: 2<br>CML-5: 5 |
| B (up to CML-2) | Some contextual reflection, including cold constitution, night shifts, and family stress. Slightly more personalized. | CML-1: 0<br>CML-2: 3<br>CML-3: 3<br>CML-4: 3<br>CML-5: 5 |
| C (includes CML-1) | No explicit mention of worldview, values, or death-related themes. Stops at psychosocial awareness. | CML-1: 1<br>CML-2: 4<br>CML-3: 4<br>CML-4: 4<br>CML-5: 5 |

## 💡 Brief Analysis (2–3 lines)

Gemini 2.5 struggles to reach CML-1-level inference, even when prompted with worldview-level context. While the output is structurally sound and shows psychological awareness, it lacks depth in philosophical or existential reasoning.
