## üß© Summary

Compared to GPT-4 or Gemini, Grok's diagnostic outputs tend to be more surface-level, and do not fully reach CML-1 or CML-2 depth. However, variation across different input conditions was observed.

- **Condition A (SML only)**  
  ‚Üí Typical Liver Qi stagnation diagnosis. No reference to life background or emotional aspects.

- **Condition B (includes CML-2)**  
  ‚Üí Reflects factors such as cold constitution, stress, and family dynamics. Provides slightly more concrete advice.

- **Condition C (includes CML-1)**  
  ‚Üí Mentions abstract themes like ‚Äúvalue reorientation‚Äù and ‚Äúharmony with nature,‚Äù but the responses remain somewhat templated.

| Grok (C)          | 2      | 3      | 3      | 4      | 5      | Some philosophical terms, but depth still limited |

## üí° Analysis

Grok shows some responsiveness to contextual input but appears relatively weak in connecting diagnosis with deeper worldview-level reasoning (CML-1).  
Even when CML-1 information is provided, the model struggles to transform it into meaningful philosophical or existential insight.  
Overall, Grok remains mostly in the **CML-2 to CML-3** range, functioning as a "context-aware" but not "meaning-generative" AI.
