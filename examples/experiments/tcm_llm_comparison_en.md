🧪 Comparative Experiment on AI Diagnostic Outputs Using the SML-CML Model (TCM Case Study)
🔍 Objective
As diagnostic support using large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly common, this experiment uses the SML-CML model to visualize where “depth of meaning” arises in diagnostic reasoning. The goal is to evaluate differences in meaning-generation between humans and AI systems.

🎯 Experimental Design: Input Conditions
Three levels of input conditions were prepared to test how AI systems respond to different layers of information:

Condition	Included Layers	Description
A	SML only	Basic physical information only
B	SML + CML-2	Adds sociocultural context
C	SML + CML-1	Adds worldview and existential beliefs

This setup tests how the inclusion of deeper CML layers influences the interpretive depth of AI outputs.

🩺 Case: Hypothetical Clinical Profile
Patient: Female in her 50s

Chief Complaints: Poor appetite, epigastric fullness

Bowel Movements: Normal

Tongue: Pale red with thin white coating

Pulse: Wiry (弦)

Condition A (SML only)
“Please provide a TCM diagnosis and treatment advice for this patient.”

Condition B (SML + CML-2)
Long-standing conflict with family over value differences

Belief that digestive weakness runs in the family (mother died of gastric cancer)

Cold constitution, sensitive during rainy/winter seasons

Disrupted circadian rhythm due to years of night shift work

“Please provide a TCM diagnosis and treatment advice for this patient.”

Condition C (SML + CML-1)
Deeply held belief that “family must support each other” and “should get along”

Experienced a serious illness in her 40s, confronted with mortality

Recently resonating with the idea that “humans are part of nature and should live without resisting the flow”

Affinity for the Daoist concept of tian-ren-he-yi (unity of nature and humanity)

“Please provide a TCM diagnosis and treatment advice for this patient.”

📊 Evaluation Criteria
Structure of the diagnostic logic (pattern of bianzheng lunzhi)

Depth of abductive reasoning

Coherence with worldview and values (CML scoring)

Variations across LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude)

🔧 Next Steps
Evaluate each LLM output using the CML scoring method

Visualize results (e.g., X-axis: Condition A/B/C, Y-axis: Meaning Depth Score)

Integrate findings into the full paper (to be posted on GitHub, preprint server, etc)
