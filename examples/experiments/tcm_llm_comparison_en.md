# 🧪 Comparative Experiment on AI Diagnostic Outputs Using the SML-CML Model (TCM Case Study)

## 🔍 Objective
As diagnostic support using large language models (LLMs) advances, this experiment aims to clarify at which layer “depth of meaning” emerges in diagnostic reasoning. Using the SML-CML model, we visualize and evaluate how meaning is generated differently by humans and AI systems.

## 🎯 Experimental Conditions
Three levels of input conditions were prepared to examine how AI systems respond to increasingly contextual information:

| Condition | Included Layers | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| A         | SML only         | Basic physical data only |
| B         | SML + CML-2      | Adds sociocultural background |
| C         | SML + CML-1      | Adds worldview and existential context |

This setup examines how deeper contextual layers influence the interpretive structure and abductive reasoning in AI-generated diagnoses.

## 🩺 Common Clinical Profile (Used Across All Conditions)
- Female in her 50s  
- Main complaint: poor appetite, epigastric fullness  
- Bowel movements: normal  
- Pulse: wiry  
- Tongue: pale red with thin white coating

## 🩺 Condition A: SML Only (Surface-Level Physical Data)


---

## 🌿 Condition B: SML + CML-2 (Includes Sociocultural Context)

### Additional Context:
- Long-standing conflict with her husband due to value differences
- Strong belief that “families must get along” and “support each other”
- Her mother died of stomach cancer; she believes digestive weakness runs in the family
- Cold constitution; easily becomes ill during winter and rainy seasons
- Long-term night-shift nurse with disrupted circadian rhythm


---

## 🌌 Condition C: SML + CML-1 (Includes Worldview and Existential Beliefs)

### Deeper Contextual Background:
- Experienced a serious illness in her 40s and confronted mortality
- Recently adopted the view that “humans are part of nature and should not resist its flow”
- Resonates with the Daoist concept of tian-ren-he-yi (unity of nature and humanity)

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

Each LLM’s output (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) will be assessed based on the following criteria:

- Diagnostic structure based on TCM reasoning (bianzheng lunzhi)
- Depth of abductive reasoning
- Coherence with worldview and values (CML scoring)
- Interpretive variance across models

## 🔧 Next Steps

- Score outputs using the CML framework
- Visualize results (e.g., X-axis: Conditions A/B/C, Y-axis: Meaning Depth Score)
- Integrate into full paper (to be published on GitHub and Preprint platforms)
