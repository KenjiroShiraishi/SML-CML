## 🏢 SML-CML Use Case: Organizational Culture and Value Alignment

### 🔍 Background
The BMJ article titled *“Culture should be a strategic priority amid the changing landscape of the healthcare system”* (BMJ 2025; 389:r928) rightly highlights the importance of organizational culture in healthcare. However, it falls short of offering concrete tools to reconcile diverse internal values.

### 🧠 The SML-CML Model
- **CML (Cosmological Meaning Layer)**: Represents core worldviews embedded in organizational culture (e.g., life extension vs quality of life).
- **SML (Semantic Meaning Layer)**: Structures the meanings and interpretations that guide daily decisions and actions.

By addressing both layers, the SML-CML model clarifies why cultural principles often break down in practice—and how to realign them.

### 🌍 Case Study
After the Great East Japan Earthquake, many individuals re-evaluated their worldview and values. This shift in CML led to corresponding changes in how life decisions (SML) were interpreted.

### ✅ Why It Matters
The SML-CML model helps:
- Explain why top-down values often fail to translate into frontline actions  
- Mediate conflicting perspectives within complex organizations  
- Serve as a practical tool for organizational culture reform
